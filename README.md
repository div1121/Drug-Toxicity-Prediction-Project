# CSCI3230-Drug-Toxicity-Prediction-Project
- Convolutional Neural Network for detecting drug toxicity
- Drug Input: Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) Expression 
- Example:

# Implementation:
1. The SMILES Expression of drug is transformed into one-hot encoding.
2. Model Representation: Adopt 4 different architecture of CNN models.

Model 1

Model 2

Model 3

Model 4

3. Early stopping is used in training progress.

# Conclusion
- After testing, model 4 achieve the best result for predicting drug toxicity without overfitting, which is used to build the final version of model in final_version folder.

- Some pretrained models are saved at model folder.
